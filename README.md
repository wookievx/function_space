This simple snippet implements basic behaviour of multiplicative and addictive functions.
There are three functional classes for now:

basic_function - simple wrapper for any callable object
multiplicative - class implementing "multiplication" of two functions
addictive - class implementing "additio" of two functions

Examples of usage are in main.cpp.

For now if you want operators work fine you have to make one of it's argument an object
of the class being one of the three definded in "space".

I would appreciate any feedback considering this code, in particular how to split it properly
into header and source file.
